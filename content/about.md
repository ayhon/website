Hello, I'm Fernando Leal, known in the internet as `ayhon`!

I'm a computer scientist interested in programming languages, software verification and theorem provers. In general, I am likely to enjoy any topic in the intersection of Computer Science and Mathematics.

In 2024 I finished my Computer Science and Mathematics Double Bachelor at [UCM](https://informatica.ucm.es/) in Madrid, Spain. That same year I started my masters in Research in Computer Science at [ENS Paris-Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/).
