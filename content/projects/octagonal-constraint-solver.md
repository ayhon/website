For my bachellor's thesis I developed and verified an octogonal constraints solver for the FORVES2 project.
The code for the solver can be found in [FORVES2's github](https://github.com/costa-group/forves2/blob/1aabbbedaaf9e7be3588b9508c49d0e7acf20b0a/octagon.v). I also recorded the presentation of my thesis, [the video](https://youtu.be/Nm9-AZ4HV4w) is available on Youtube.
