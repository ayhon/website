Welcome to the ENSPSCS24 Conference, a mock Computer Science and Programming Languages conference organized by the ENS Paris-Saclay MPRI master program. This conference aims to provide students with hands-on experience in the academic submission process.

## Call for Papers

We invite submissions of original research papers, short papers, and posters related to all aspects of computer science and programming languages. We encourage submissions from diverse areas, including but not limited to:

- Programming paradigms
- Software engineering
- Algorithms and data structures
- Computational theory
- Language design and implementation

## Scope

ENSPSCS24 welcomes contributions that explore innovative ideas, theoretical frameworks, and empirical studies. We aim to foster discussions that advance knowledge and understanding within the computer science community.

## Evaluation Criteria

Submissions will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

- **Originality**: Novelty and creativity of the research.
- **Technical Quality**: Rigor and soundness of the methodology.
- **Clarity**: Clarity of writing and presentation of ideas.
- **Relevance**: Alignment with the conference scope.

## Double-Blind Reviewing

All submissions will undergo a double-blind review process to ensure impartial evaluation. Authors must ensure that their identities are not revealed in the submission.

Each submission will be reviewed by at least two program committee members. Reviewers will provide detailed feedback and scores based on the evaluation criteria outlined above. The program committee will make final decisions based on the reviewers' recommendations.

## Submission Site Information

All papers must be submitted electronically via the conference submission site: [ENSPSCS24 Submission Site](http://enspscs24.submissions.com). Detailed instructions for creating an account and submitting papers are provided on the site.

## Conflicts of Interest

Reviewers must declare any conflicts of interest that may affect their impartiality. Authors are encouraged to disclose any potential conflicts in their submissions.

## Artifact Evaluation for Accepted Papers

Authors of accepted papers are encouraged to submit artifacts (e.g., code, data) for evaluation. These artifacts will be assessed for reproducibility and usability.

## Copyright, Publication, and Presentation

Accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings. Authors retain copyright but grant the conference a license to publish the work. All accepted authors are expected to present their work at the conference.

## Distinguished Paper Awards

A selection of outstanding papers will receive Distinguished Paper Awards. These awards recognize exceptional quality in research and presentation.
